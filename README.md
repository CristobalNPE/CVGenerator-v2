# CV Creator

## Project Description

CV Creator is one of my initial projects, designed to streamline the creation of a curriculum vitae by prompting users for information and generating customized CVs in various templates. The tool aims to simplify and expedite the CV creation process, offering templates that cater to different preferences â€” from minimalistic designs to more elaborate and visually appealing formats.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies with npm install.
2. Run the application using npm run dev.
3. Access it through your web browser at localhost.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I honed my skills in state management, leveraging the Zustand library. Additionally, I refined my use of TailwindCSS with the ShadCN ui library and delved into the world of TypeScript, enhancing my understanding of type-safe coding practices.

## Future Plans

Looking ahead, the project's roadmap includes the following enhancements:

- Improve date pickers and streamline the application flow for a more user-friendly experience.
- Implement a backend with user accounts, granting users access to their created curriculums.
- Provide options for downloading the curriculum as a PDF or sharing it seamlessly.
